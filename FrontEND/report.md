### 1. Trading Style Classification: **Long-Term / Position Trader**
Tejas_Host demonstrates a pure **Long-Term / Position Trader** style. Despite a high frequency of activity (44 trades), the player has not sold a single asset. This behavior indicates a strong "Buy and Hold" mentality, focusing entirely on wealth accumulation and the "big picture" rather than reacting to short-term market fluctuations. The player shows exceptional discipline in avoiding impulsive selling, though the lack of any exits suggests they are still in a "collection phase."

### 2. Best Trade Analysis (Strategic Selection)
**Asset Focus:** *Diversified Stock & Physical Gold Portfolio*
*   **Reasoning:** While no trades have been closed (realized), the player’s best decision was the **high-frequency accumulation of Stocks (18 trades) and Physical Gold (16 trades).** 
*   **Quality:** By spreading purchases across these two categories, the player built a balanced foundation. The decision to keep buying consistently suggests "Rupee Cost Averaging"—a professional strategy where you buy regardless of price to build a strong average entry point over time.

### 3. Worst Trade Analysis (Behavioral Observation)
**Behavioral Gap:** *The "Zero-Exit" Strategy*
*   **Reasoning:** There is no single "bad" buy, but the **lack of any sell actions** across 44 trades is a risk. 
*   **Quality:** In trading, profit is only "real" once you sell. By never selling, the player remains 100% exposed to market drops. If the value of Stocks or Gold were to fall suddenly, the player would lose their accumulated gains because they didn't "lock in" profits at any point. This reflects a potential "collector" mindset rather than a "trader" mindset.

### 4. Actionable Improvement Advice

*   **Learn to "Harvest" Profits:** Just like a farmer plants seeds (buys) and eventually harvests the crop (sells), a trader must sell some assets when they have grown in value. Try selling 10% of your holdings when you see a profit to understand how "Realized P/L" works.
*   **Set a Goal for Each Trade:** Before buying, ask: "When will I sell this?" Having a plan (e.g., "I will sell if it grows by 20%") helps turn a collection of assets into a professional trading strategy.
*   **Understand Liquidity:** You have a lot of "Physical Gold." In the real world, physical items take longer to sell than digital ones. Try exploring more "Digital Gold" or "Stocks" to see how quickly you can move in and out of positions.
*   **Monitor the 'Big Picture':** Since you are a Long-Term Trader, keep an eye on why you bought an asset. If the reason changes (e.g., a company is no longer doing well), it’s okay to sell and move your money to a better opportunity.
